There are many technologies to acquire such data, with trade-offs in spatial resolution, speed, and compatibility with other kinds of experiments on the same tissue sample Chen et al. (2023). Some of these technologies, namely SeqFISH, MERFISH, Slide-Seq have been used to produce atlas scale datasets in the mouse brain by the BICCN~Hawrylycz et al. (2023). Here we focus on a whole mouse brain dataset obtained with an in-situ hybridization based technique called MERFISH Yao et al. (2023). This dataset consists of expression measurements of approximately 500 genes in 4 million cells from a single mouse brain.\n\n\nBackground on neuropeptidergic communication\nLigands are small molecules that bind selectively to receptor proteins. Peptides are small chains of amino acids. Here the ligands of interest are peptides, and the receptor proteins of interest are GPCRs Rosenbaum, Rasmussen, and Kobilka (2009). Peptides released by one neuron can bind to GPCRs on other neurons and modulate their activity. Thus, compatible (a.k.a cognate) peptide-GPCR pairs can be considered as unique communication channels Smith et al. (2019). ~ Importantly, such peptidergic signaling is slower and longer lasting compared to synaptic signaling. Recently neurons have been grouped into based on genome-wide mRNA expression (\\(\\sim\\) 20,000 unique genes per cell). Combinatorial expression of neuropeptides and receptors enables local, type specific communication between neurons. Computational studies also suggest that such neuron-type–specific local neuromodulation may be a critical piece of the biological credit-assignment puzzle Liu et al. (2021).\n\\[\n\\mathcal{L} = \\sum_{u \\in V}{P(\\mathcal{N}(u) | f(u))}\n\\]\n\n\nApplication of GNNs for analysis of spatial transcriptomic data\nThis section covers recent GNN-based methods described in the literature Figure 1.\nimport numpy as np\nfor i in range(1)\n    pass\nSpaGCN~(Hu et al. 2021): This approach uses gene expression, spatial location, and a histology image to construct a graph. Nodes are either cells (MERFISH data), or spots (10x Visium data). Edge weights capture proximity in spatial coordinates and similarity of RGB values in the histology image. A GCN layer Kipf and Welling (2016) provides node embeddings that are clustered by a differentiable clustering layer Xie, Girshick, and Farhadi (2015). These layers are trained jointly to optimize a clustering objective Xie, Girshick, and Farhadi (2015). The resulting node clusters are interpreted as domains. A separate differential gene analysis is performed to obtain across domains.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nChen, Tsai-Ying, Li You, Jose Angelito U Hardillo, and Miao-Ping Chien. 2023. “Spatial Transcriptomic Technologies.” Cells 12 (16): 2042.\n\n\nHawrylycz, Michael, Maryann E Martone, Giorgio A Ascoli, Jan G Bjaalie, Hong-Wei Dong, Satrajit S Ghosh, Jesse Gillis, et al. 2023. “A Guide to the BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network Data Ecosystem.” PLoS Biology 21 (6): e3002133.\n\n\nHu, Jian, Xiangjie Li, Kyle Coleman, Amelia Schroeder, Nan Ma, David J Irwin, Edward B Lee, Russell T Shinohara, and Mingyao Li. 2021. “SpaGCN: Integrating Gene Expression, Spatial Location and Histology to Identify Spatial Domains and Spatially Variable Genes by Graph Convolutional Network.” Nature Methods 18 (11): 1342–51.\n\n\nKipf, Thomas N, and Max Welling. 2016. “Semi-Supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks.” arXiv Preprint arXiv:1609.02907.\n\n\nLein, Ed, Lars E Borm, and Sten Linnarsson. 2017. “The Promise of Spatial Transcriptomics for Neuroscience in the Era of Molecular Cell Typing.” Science 358 (6359): 64–69.\n\n\nLiu, Yuhan Helena, Stephen Smith, Stefan Mihalas, Eric Shea-Brown, and Uygar Sümbül. 2021. “Cell-Type–Specific Neuromodulation Guides Synaptic Credit Assignment in a Spiking Neural Network.” Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 118 (51): e2111821118.\n\n\nMarx, Vivien. 2021. “Method of the Year: Spatially Resolved Transcriptomics.” Nature Methods 18 (1): 9–14.\n\n\nMoffitt, Jeffrey R, Emma Lundberg, and Holger Heyn. 2022. “The Emerging Landscape of Spatial Profiling Technologies.” Nature Reviews Genetics 23 (12): 741–59.\n\n\nOrtiz, Cantin, Marie Carlén, and Konstantinos Meletis. 2021. “Spatial Transcriptomics: Molecular Maps of the Mammalian Brain.” Annual Review of Neuroscience 44 (1): 547–62.\n\n\nRosenbaum, Daniel M, Søren GF Rasmussen, and Brian K Kobilka. 2009. “The Structure and Function of g-Protein-Coupled Receptors.” Nature 459 (7245): 356–63.\n\n\nSmith, Stephen J, Uygar Sümbül, Lucas T Graybuck, Forrest Collman, Sharmishtaa Seshamani, Rohan Gala, Olga Gliko, et al. 2019. “Single-Cell Transcriptomic Evidence for Dense Intracortical Neuropeptide Networks.” Elife 8: e47889.\n\n\nXie, J, R Girshick, and A Farhadi. 2015. “Unsupervised Deep Embedding for Clustering Analysis.
